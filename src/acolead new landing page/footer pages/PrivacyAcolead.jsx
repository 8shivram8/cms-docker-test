              <li>

          Users can delete certain types of data (e.g., leads, uploaded
          documents, and product listings) directly from the AcoLead platform

        {/* NEW SECTION: Mobile App Permissions & Data Usage */}
        <h2>8. Mobile App Permissions and Data Usage</h2>

        <h3>
          A. Call Log and Phone Data Usage (READ_CALL_LOG, PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS,
          READ_PHONE_STATE)
        </h3>
        <p>
          AcoLead requests access to your call logs and phone state. This access
          is strictly limited to the core functionality of our mobile
          application: automated lead management for your business calls.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Why we need these permissions:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic Call Logging:</strong> To automatically detect and
            log calls made to or received from your leads, including call
            direction (incoming/outgoing), duration, and timestamp. This helps
            keep your CRM records up-to-date without manual entry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lead Identification:</strong> To identify incoming and
            outgoing calls from numbers already stored in your AcoLead CRM and
            display relevant lead information on-screen during the call.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Post-Call Actions:</strong> To trigger a prompt
            immediately after a call ends so you can record the call outcome,
            add notes, update lead status, or schedule a follow-up task.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phone State Handling:</strong> READ_PHONE_STATE is used to
            detect when a call is ringing, active, or has ended, in order to
            show or hide the AcoLead call overlay and post-call prompt at the
            correct time.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>How we handle call and phone data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Processing:</strong> Call log and phone state data are
            processed locally on your device to match phone numbers against your
            existing AcoLead lead database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Syncing:</strong> Only call details related to phone
            numbers that you manage as leads or contacts in AcoLead are synced
            to our secure servers to update your CRM records. We do{" "}
            <strong>not</strong> upload your entire call history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Third-Party Selling:</strong> We do{" "}
            <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or transfer your call log data to
            any third parties. This data is used solely for your business
            management purposes within the AcoLead platform.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Contacts Data Usage (READ_CONTACTS)</h3>
        <p>
          AcoLead requests access to your device&apos;s contacts. This access is
          used only to improve your experience in managing and identifying
          leads.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Why we need this permission:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Caller Identification:</strong> To display the name of the
            caller (from your device contacts) in the AcoLead call overlay when
            you receive or make a call, helping you immediately recognize who is
            calling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lead Enrichment:</strong> When a call is logged as a new
            lead, we use your contacts to automatically populate the lead&apos;s
            name in AcoLead, reducing manual data entry.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>How we handle contacts data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Access:</strong> Your contacts are accessed locally on
            your device to match phone numbers with names.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selective Sync:</strong> We do{" "}
            <strong>not</strong> upload your entire address book to our servers.
            Only the name and number associated with a specific call or lead
            that you choose to log into the CRM is synced to your AcoLead
            account.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Data Retention and Deletion (Google Play User Data Policy)</h3>
        <p>
          We retain your personal and business data, including any call log data
          and contact details that have been synced to your AcoLead CRM, only
          for as long as your account is active and as necessary to provide our
          services or comply with legal obligations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Your deletion options:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can delete specific leads, call records linked to those leads,
            and other business data directly from within the AcoLead application
            or web interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can delete your entire account and all associated synced data
            (including call logs and contacts stored in AcoLead) by using the{" "}
            <strong>&quot;Delete Account&quot;</strong> option inside the app or
            by contacting us at{" "}
            <a href="mailto:info@coalitionify.com">info@coalitionify.com</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your request is verified, all personal data associated with
            your account that we store (including synced call logs and relevant
            contact information) will be permanently removed from our servers
            within <strong>7 business days</strong>, except where we are legally
            required to retain certain records (e.g., billing or tax
            information).
          </li>
        </ul>
